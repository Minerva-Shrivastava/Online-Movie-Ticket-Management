# Online-Movie-Ticket-Management

Most of us watch movies for recreation. Sometime movies make us emotional and sometimes they educate us about different cultures, societies and even about science. Most of the time we enjoy movies at home but often we go to the cinema to get better experience. It would be very nice if we could know all the necessary information before being physically present at the theatre. The information may be like which movies are being shown now and which are coming soon, what the hall-categories and their respective seat-prices are, availability of seats for a specific show-time, etc. We selected our project so that people would get all these information easily and then can reserve seats online. And we have accomplished our goal successfully.

## Key Features:

The key features of the project are listed below:
<br/>From end-users’ perspective:

* Searching options.
* Brief information about a movie and option to watch the trailer online.
* Detailed schedules.
* Categorized movies according to the format (2D or 3D).
* Detailed pricing information for different types of cinema halls based on movie format.
* A model different sections in the cinema-hall is available where reserved seats are marked with different color. Here seats can be selected for reservation.
* 3-step seat reservation system.

<br/>From developers’ perspective:
* 3-layer design.
* Application of Design Patterns.
* Easily maintainable and modifiable code-base.

## Design Patterns:
To utilize the concepts of Object Oriented Designs, we have implemented two Design Patterns in the Java code. The patterns are:
* Factory Pattern
* Initialization on Demand Holder (Lazy-Loaded Singleton).
* MVC Pattern

##Technologies & Software have been used:
* Oracle (PL/SQL)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Java / Java EE (Jsp & Servlet)



## Scope of improvements:
We could not have completed the admin-panel due to shortage of time. And the confirmation in the 3rd phase of seat reservation is not enough at this moment. So in these two sections, we have much to improve further.
